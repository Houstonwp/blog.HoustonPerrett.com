I've made a $130 contribution to [BEAM](https://www.beam.community/). If you're reading this, you likely have the means to make a similar contribution to an organization. I challenge you to do so. Send me an email [hp@houstonp.com](mailto:hp@houstonp.com) with a receipt of the organization you contributed to, and I'll make some sort of contribution as well.

Not sure where to donate? Here's [115](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/where-to-donate-for-black-lives-matter.html) to choose from.

Have a great week.

Houston
