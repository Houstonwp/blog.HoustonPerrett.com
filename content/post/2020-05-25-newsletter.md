"Hey all you cool cats and kittens..." It's been a while. A lot of people have been asking about the blog. I'm still at it. Still reading. The last three months have been rough. We can probably all agree on that. My consumption of news and media during this time led to unhealthy thoughts. I took a media detox, connected more with friends and loved ones, and reset my state of mind. I love reading and paying to support quality journalism. The work journalists are doing, especially right now, is valuable, but I'm also aware that constantly reading about the state of the world is exhausting and depressing.

Below you'll find links I've saved throughout this time. I've done my best to group them into categories that might interest you.

Have a great week.
