The terms innovation and disruption get discussed in insurance circles often. The words are used interchangeably to mean any sort of technology or improvement that will impact the industry and change the competitive landscape. Any follower of Professor Clayton Christensen's work will tell you this is mistake. It's a mistake that leads to misguided decision making. Let's start off with a definition:

> _Innovation_ -- a technology or improvement that will impact the industry and change the competitive landscape.

This is the same sentence as above. It's a wide ranging topic that spans all areas of the business. It is an intentionally vague definition because innovation is in itself vague. It could be anything from making electronic delivery of statements opt-out to chat bots to new products.

### Professor Christensen breaks innovation up in to two categories: sustaining and disruptive.

## Sustaining Innovation

A sustaining innovation involves iterative improvement (or even major developments) to the value chain of a company's existing customer base. Whether it's iterative or not is irrelevant, but the key focus is on a company's (or industry's) _existing customers_ .

#### Example 1: Algorithmic Underwriting

> Over the last five years, algorithms to make underwriting decisions have become wide spread in the life insurance industry. The technology has cut the length of time to acquiring a policy for certain individuals in half. More and more insurers have added their own form of algorithmic underwriting. What customers benefit the most from algorithmic underwriting? In most cases only healthy individuals that meet the standards of the first or second best risk classes are eligible, i.e., customers most likely to have low mortality, i.e., more profitable customers. The value chain hasn’t changed. Instead of competing on who has the best underwriters, it’s now who has the best algorithm. The product hasn’t changed. The distribution model hasn’t changed. The customer hasn't changed. It is an efficiency in the process -- a sustaining innovation.

#### Example 2: Autonomous Cars.

> Autonomous driving is making headlines every week. Most car manufacturers are working diligently on bringing autonomous driving to market. There are incredible upsides for the consumer ranging from safety to travel time. Who is the consumer though? Who is benefiting from a self-driving car? In all likelihood, the consumer buying a vehicle is someone who would own a vehicle regardless of it being autonomous. The customer hasn't changed. The value chain hasn't changed. Instead of competing over gas mileage or interior space, now car manufacturers are also competing on their self-driving technology. The product hasn't changed. The distribution model hasn't changed. The customer hasn't changed. It is an efficiency in the process -- a sustaining innovation. 

Both examples are often associated with the term disruption, but as I've explored both innovations above, _they are sustaining innovations_.

## Disruptive Innovation

A disruptive innovation targets the value chain itself by focusing on a neglected or ignored customer base. These groups of customers aren't profitable for incumbents given their market strategy. The timing of disruption is often misunderstood. It does not have
