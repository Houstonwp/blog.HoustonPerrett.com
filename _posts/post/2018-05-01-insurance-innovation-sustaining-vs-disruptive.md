The terms innovation and disruption get discussed in insurance circles often. The words are used interchangeably to mean any sort of technology or improvement that will impact the industry and change the competitive landscape. Any follower of Professor Clayton Christensen's work will tell you this is mistake. It's a mistake that leads to misguided decision making. Let's start off with a definition:

> _Innovation_ -- a technology or improvement that will impact the industry and change the competitive landscape.

This is the same sentence as above. It's a wide ranging topic that spans all areas of the business. It is an intentionally vague definition because innovation is in itself vague. It could be anything from making electronic delivery of statements opt-out to chat bots to new products.

### Professor Christensen breaks innovation up in to two categories: sustaining and disruptive.

## Sustaining Innovation

A sustaining innovation involves iterative improvement (or even major developments) to the value chain of a company's existing customer base. Whether it's iterative or not is irrelevant, but the key focus is on a company's (or industry's) _existing customers_ .

#### Example 1: Algorithmic Underwriting

> Over the last five years, algorithms to make underwriting decisions have become wide spread in the life insurance industry. The technology has cut the length of time to acquiring a policy for certain individuals in half. More and more insurers have added their own form of algorithmic underwriting. What customers benefit the most from algorithmic underwriting? In most cases only healthy individuals that meet the standards of the first or second best risk classes are eligible, i.e., customers most likely to have low mortality, i.e., more profitable customers. The value chain hasn’t changed. Instead of competing on who has the best underwriters, it’s now who has the best algorithm. The product hasn’t changed. The distribution model hasn’t changed. The customer hasn't changed. It is an efficiency in the process -- a sustaining innovation.

#### Example 2: Autonomous Cars.

> Autonomous driving is making headlines every week. Most car manufacturers are working diligently on bringing autonomous driving to market. There are incredible upsides for the consumer ranging from safety to travel time. Who is the consumer though? Who is benefiting from a self-driving car? In all likelihood, the consumer buying a vehicle is someone who would own a vehicle regardless of it being autonomous. The customer hasn't changed. The value chain hasn't changed. Instead of competing over gas mileage or interior space, now car manufacturers are also competing on their self-driving technology. The product hasn't changed. The distribution model hasn't changed. The customer hasn't changed. It is an efficiency in the process -- a sustaining innovation. 

Both examples are often associated with the term disruption, but as I've explored both innovations above, _they are sustaining innovations_.

## Disruptive Innovation

A disruptive innovation targets the value chain itself by focusing on a neglected or ignored customer base. These groups of customers aren't profitable for incumbents given their market strategy. The timing of disruption is often misunderstood. It does not have to occur in an instant. Disruption can take many forms and over any amounts of time. The key of a disruptive innovation is improving the product and moving upmarket. By moving upmarket, the disruptive organization is now eating into the incumbents market share. This is the peak of disruption. The incumbent doesn't have the organization or culture to embrace the disruptive innovation. 

#### Example 1: Netflix.

> In 1997 Netflix started out as a DVD by mail business. They had a relatively limited collection of back catalog content from a few studios, and in 2007 Netflix pivoted and started internet streaming content. This catered to a specific movie buff and technology literate audience. With an expanding catalog, customer data, and internet streaming, Netflix was able to entice more studios and create their own content. They moved up market and disrupted the entire movie rental industry.

>(_Blockbuster went out of business six years after Netflix introduced streaming_.)

#### Example 2: Autonomous Cars.

> Yes, autonomous cars were listed as a sustaining technology. The value proposition in the case of current car customers hasn't changed. But, when you implement Uber's business model, it changes the paradigm. Now fleets of autonomous cars can usher around consumers instead of needing to purchase a vehicle. The value chain in this scenario has changed. The customer who cannot afford to purchase a vehicle now has easy access to an on demand vehicle to take them wherever they would like.

> (_This is fundamentally different from Uber's current business model as essentially a digital platform for an at will taxi service_.)

## Evaluating Insurance Innovation

When looking further at other innovations in the insurance industry with this new lens, we see that a lot of the purported "disruptive" innovations are actually sustaining innovations. The way companies have positioned machine learning, data analytics, artificial intelligence, etc. are as sustaining technologies. They are iterative improvements to the current value chain. They are adding value to their current customers. To their credit, these are important developments and will improve countless areas of the business, but by definition, they are not disruptive.

Professor Christensen argues that the strategy of handling sustaining and disruptive innovation are different. The strategy for sustaining innovations is relatively straight forward:
* Acquiring or partnering with a company who is already developing the innovation.
* Investing in resources to develop the innovation in house.

This strategy is playing out to a tee in the insurtech space and aligns with the idea of a sustaining innovation.

It's hard to say where disruptive innovation is occurring in the insurance industry. The regulatory framework makes it difficult for startups to _not_ partner with insurers due to capital requirements, lack of open, available data, and a general reluctance for change. When disruption does occur, _and it will_, incumbent insurers will be ill prepared to mitigate the damage it will cause.
