I’ve been asked by a few individuals why I loathe SOA articles about actuarial systems and modeling. It’s a fair question. I’ll walk through my reasoning. I‘m happy to hear counterpoints and have a constructive discussion.

Actuaries have had a long and proud history. It’s a history of evaluating and pricing risk. Over the course of hundreds of years, the process to do it has evolved from basic statistics and paper to the advent of computers.

In that time actuaries have become complacent and are willing to stop evolving, stop progressing, stop modernizing to the point that the relevancy of an actuary is in jeopardy. There is a reason why you see so much work and development around data analytics, predictive analytics, and data data data. People are scared that the profession isn’t going to be relevant in the future, and they’re rightfully concerned. Actuaries' time is not spent doing what actuaries are supposed to do. 

When I look at LDTI, I see the industry struggling. The FASB has pushed back the deadline for compliance two years. They’ve done that based on feedback from insurers of meeting compliance and doing it in a modern and sophisticated way.

When I look at the work the industry is doing to meet these compliance standards and a lot of work each company in the industry is doing in general a lot of it’s redundant and a lot of it’s work that multiple companies should not be figuring out themselves independently or relying on a consultant in order to understand what to do actually his arm thought of us thought leaders in the insurance industry and they’re failing

Why is it that actuaries rely on proprietary software to do essentially all the exact same calculations when we’re talking about reserves or reserves simply just the present value of future expected cash flows that’s what the reserve is. And relying on these proprietary systems are holding the industry in the profession back it’s putting it in an unnecessary hurdle in place to fulfill I think the role of actuaries and insurance and in society

For something as important as a reserve they the fundamental calculation of an actuary it’s a shame that the profession isn’t working together to come up with a modern an open solution that anyone and everyone can utilize a reserve isn’t a competitive advantage it’s a fundamental requirement of insurance and of the business and professional network in for actuaries not collaborate and come together to put together a solution that is open free

By working together and collaborating with others in the field including regulators and auditors actually has come up with a solution to satisfy the fundamental requirement of the profession this should open up more possibilities then whatever proprietary system claims that it’s able to do a proprietary system inherently boxes you win and locks you into an ecosystem that by definition doesn’t allow innovation and collaboration and a sharing of knowledge that will progress the profession forward.

imagine the industry and the profession working with regulators hand-in-hand on a solution that meets the requirements of regulations and code and in spirit and satisfies those requirements in a way that allows companies to be innovative and allows companies to test and design new solutions that fit a framework that’s codified instead of hoping that they can convince the regulator in an auditor that it’s OK.

I’ve already heard from any visuals who have said why would companies do that as a cost it cost money and manpower and time and effort and why would they do that all for free but there’s a larger obligation to the profession and society the customers of insurance companies the ones that rely on this this should be a competitive advantage that sets one insurance company part is how they do a reserve calculation

The same token I don’t understand the logic behind paying consultants to tell you what other companies are doing when you could just work collaboratively together to come up with the proper solution that meets regulators and auditors needs and requirements cut out the middleman and work on a solution together a solution that is better

When I look at the value of an annuity or life insurance product the reserve calculation is not in that equation if I am a customer I am looking at customer service experience reputability and financial strength of the company cost

A free and open cord does not hinder ask for his ability to develop new and innovative products in fact it probably does the opposite it allows actual racist to not worry about the core fundamental concepts the core library is that meat regulations and can instead focus on adding value and doing what actuaries are supposed to do evaluating and pricing risk and coming up with solutions that allow individuals and businesses to live in financial security
